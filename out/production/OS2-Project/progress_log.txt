3.-17.3.:

I have implemented the classes Player, Table, Card and Deck almost entirely. The method for changing a Player's name is still missing.
I have also started the implementation of the Game class. The most significant commands are being handled in the playTurn method.
I have also implemented the check method and tested the classes mentioned in the class TestGame with commands of the correct format.
I have also started the implementation of the load method in its own TestFile class for now. I wanted to start working on the user interface
a bit earlier before the file handling methods but I had some trouble getting the Scala Swing library working. Now it's working and I've been testing it out.
All in all I've used about 12 hours so far on my project.

Now I have started the implementation of my GUI and done some finetuning to the Game class. For example I implemented a
command handling method subjectToCard that turns the card-strings into Cards. The GUI is coming along nicely and
I'm hoping to get it working during the next two weeks. I'd also like to get the file handling methods working during the next two weeks.
My plan has changed a little from the initial one and now I'm trying to get the GUI class working before starting on the computer opponent.

1.-14.4.:

Now my GUI is working and I have also built the computer opponent and it is working with the GUI and the rest of the game.
I've implemented the save and load methods so that they work with just regular players being in the game, but the handling of computer opponents
are yet to be done. The computer opponent evaluates its turns well, but it could still be improved. I seem to be on schedule and in addition to
improving the computer opponent and the save and load methods, I wish to do some last minute touches to my code and search for bugs
probably with unit testing.
