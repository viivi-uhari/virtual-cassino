3.-17.3.:

I have implemented the classes os2.cassino.Player, Table, os2.cassino.Card and os2.cassino.Deck almost entirely. The method for changing a os2.cassino.Player's name is still missing.
I have also started the implementation of the os2.cassino.Game class. The most significant commands are being handled in the playTurn method.
I have also implemented the check method and tested the classes mentioned in the class TestGame with commands of the correct format.
I have also started the implementation of the load method in its own TestFile class for now. I wanted to start working on the user interface
a bit earlier before the file handling methods but I had some trouble getting the Scala Swing library working. Now it's working and I've been testing it out.
All in all I've used about 12 hours so far on my project.
